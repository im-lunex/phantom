# Phantom

A simple text editor inspired by Hecto. This is a learning project to explore building a terminal-based text editor in Rust. The editor provides basic functionality for opening, editing, and saving text files with a terminal UI.

## Inspiration

This project follows the educational approach of the [Hecto tutorial](https://github.com/pflenker/hecto-tutorial), demonstrating how to build a practical text editor from scratch using Rust.
